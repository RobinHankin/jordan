A _Jordan algebra_ is a non-associative algebra over the reals with
a bilinear multiplication that satisfies the following identities:

$$xy=yx$$

$$(xy)(xx)=x(y(xx))$$

(the second identity is known as the Jordan identity).  In literature
one usually indicates multiplication by juxtaposition but one
sometimes sees $x\circ y$.  Package idiom is to use an asterisk, as in
`x*y`.  There are five types of Jordan algebras, all of which have
their own representation in the package, which uses S4 methods.
